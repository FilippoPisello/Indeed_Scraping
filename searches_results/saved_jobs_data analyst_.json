Born in social our work is now full service, simply loving big ideas that connect and create real change for our clients business. We are independently owned, founded in 2009 with offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, Sydney and Mexico City. And we're not too bad at what we do, with our work winning in Cannes Lions, the Clios, D&AD and The Webbies to name a few.\n\nHere in London we have huge ambitions. We've doubled in size over the last year and broadened both our client list and the kind of work we're doing for them. Our roots are in social and we love it - it's where we get to understand different audiences, to experiment, to gain insight and to see how people really engage and respond to ideas.\n\nWe are creative and media in equal measure because both are equally important in developing effective communications. A lot of our work in-house (with our own production, edit and motion teams) because execution is key to effectiveness. We believe 100% that brands can be built on digital platforms and part of our model is built bottom up, flipping the traditional advertising model and process on its head. We don't play to agency/industry norms and our culture and energy reflects that.\n\nWe have an incredible client list across UK, EMEA and Globally. Our ideas live and breathe in organic and paid social but also fully integrated campaigns including TVCs, radio, press, OOH (you name it we're there). Our difference? We learn fast - from what we see and how our audiences really act, alongside cultural cues to create our integrated campaigns.\n\nInfused with the DNA of our founder, we pride ourselves on our entrepreneurial spirit. Being an independent agency affords us the freedom to be bold and stray from convention. It also allows us to pivot quickly, which is key to succeeding in an ever-changing market. The same way Gary was one of the early YouTube influencers, VaynerMedia has been the forerunner in many opportunities, serving as alpha/beta launch partners with platforms from Facebook and YouTube to TikTok and Snapchat.\n\nBut ultimately we are people people.

You're someone who's driven to constantly look for better ways to do things and excited at the prospect of working in a constantly evolving industry with far more \"unknown\" than \"known\", and love playing a leadership role on a team that shares your drive to always continue learning.\n\nThe Ideal Candidate Has:\n\n1-2+ years of media analytics and insights experience\nResult-oriented with the ability to work within strict time constraints while balancing multiple projects\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills with the ability to interact at all levels of the organisation\nA collaborative teammate with the knack to pivot in a constantly evolving environment\nKnowledge of a variety of measurement methodologies and their applications\nPassionate about research, television, marketing, emerging media, and technology\nStrong PowerPoint/Excel and Google Slide/Sheet skills\nExperience with one or more media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, DCM, DV360, The Trade Desk\nExperience with SQL, Tableau and Python\nQuery and analyse complex data sets to develop actionable insights that enable the optimisation of media and content.\nAnalyse and correlate media campaign performance with audience data, including identification of high-impact KPIs for tactics with a focus on audience engagement, campaign effectiveness, fan growth and content deep dives.\nBS in Mathematics, Economics, Computer Science, Information Management or Statistics\n\nHow we will support you:\n\nWe know talent is our most important asset and our people guide our work and our culture. The last year and a half has challenged us like nothing before, and we are committed to providing the support and flexibility needed for people to do their best work and have fun doing it. We are an open minded bunch and we value diversity of thought and experience. Every person we hire will make us a more creative, innovative and happier agency. You are always welcome to bring an idea or opinion to our work and our ways of working.\n\nFor now, these are some of things we have in place to support you...\n\nWe regularly review our benefits and are committed to providing a comprehensive programme for our people.

We have our mental health partner Sanctus on hand for employee coaching sessions and an Employee Assistance Programme in place should you need it also. We partner with NABS also, an industry specific support organisation who are passionate about helping people thrive.\n\nSometimes it can be the smaller things that make you smile. We have a subsidised ClassPass offering for any fitness lovers, a wide variety of discounts and benefits through Perkbox and you can save on your commute through Commuter Club or our Cycle To Work Scheme. If R&R is more your thing you can take some time out for a monthly massage, join one of our bi-weekly mindfulness sessions or an employee led yoga sessions.

Student hires are an integral part of our continued success as one of the UK’s top Recovery Audit companies. We now take on over 30-40 students per year across the UK. You will sometimes hear of student placements schemes involving non-business-related tasks - at PRGX this is not the case.\n\n\nPreparing you for the “Real World”\nAt PRGX you’ll get the exposure to both the soft skills and behavioral traits essential for progressing your career that you may not at other organisations. You’ll conduct work for clients across many industries where you will develop your skills around communication, teamwork, client interaction including composing business emails, telephone manner, time management, organisation, work ethic and professionalism.

Being a global organisation we sometimes even offer opportunities around the world.\n\n\nEssential hard skills (and soft skills) that you’ll gain exposure to\n\nWhen applying for jobs today it is very likely you will require experience of Microsoft packages. At PRGX this is one suite of tools we offer training on while in the programme. If you wish to gain exposure to something outside of your job then we’ll try and accommodate this for you, whether it’s to improve your PowerPoint skills and deliver presentations, incorporate a more sales or data focus to your role or gain exposure to a certain technology such as SQL, we’ll try and make this happen.\n\n\nOur PRGX culture\n\nAs well as working hard at PRGX we also like to have fun. Our Social Committee ensures that regular events are organised such as Summer and Christmas gatherings, bowling, golf days and Tough Mudder participation to name a few. Due to the amount of students at PRGX there is always a social buzz outside of the workplace and lifetime friendships are made.\n\n\nOur student placement programme is a great grounding for your career offering endless opportunities both during your placement year and beyond.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\nSandra Williams-Carraro\n\nHR Resourcing Specialist | PRGX UK, Ltd\n\nstudentplacement@prgx.com\n\n\nTestimonials\n\n\nShreyas – Bath University\n\nThe PRGX placement experience throws you in the deep end straight away, allowing you to make real sizeable contributions to the business.
