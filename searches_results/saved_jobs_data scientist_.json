We are uniquely placed to use data to help make better decisions and improve data literacy across Deliveroo.\n\nData Scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a highly active data science community, with guest lecturers, study groups, mentorship programmes, a robust technical review process, and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. Data Scientists can equally progress as technical leads (individual contributors) and as people managers.\n\nOur data scientists come from all kinds of backgrounds but have excellence in common. Many are formally trained in data science, many are not. We celebrate difference and have a dedicated data science diversity committee.\n\nAt Deliveroo we're always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we're working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.\n\nExperimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we're investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We're looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.\n\nSome of the problems we're working to solve:\n\nHow can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?\nHow can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?\nHow can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?\nHow can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?\nHow can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?\nHow can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?\n\nResponsibilities:\n\nInvestigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.\nLeveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods\nPrototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances\nPrototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team\n\nQualifications:\n\nPhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics (equivalent business experience)\nBroad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods\nFamiliarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset\n\nData Science at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\nBenefits and Diversity\nAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space."

One that advances humanity and protects the environment, powered by technology?\nIn 2021, Octopus Energy founded Centre for Net Zero. We are an impact-driven research lab working at the intersection of tech, energy and climate researching how we can deliver a faster, fairer and more affordable energy transition. We are an autonomous team that sets our own research agenda. Whilst we work closely with Octopus Energy, we are a separate organisation that is part of the Octopus Energy group of companies.\nAs an innovative and high growth global company, Octopus Energy has access to millions of progressive energy customers with billions of corresponding data points. This gives us unprecedented insight into the energy behaviours of tomorrow, today. We believe that through transparent research, opening up data and building tools in a tech-first way, we can work together to co-design the future energy system.\nOur work this year will initially focus on extending our knowledge in consumer understanding, focusing on the behaviour of these consumers and how they use low-carbon technologies through a series of research projects. As we deepen our knowledge, we will be cognizant of ways we can build tools and data products to support energy researchers, innovators and policymakers around the world. Later this year, we will be engaging in longer-form research projects with influential organisations that expand on our existing collaborations with The Turing Institute and Cramton Associates.\nWe are looking for a Data Scientist to join the research team. The primary focus will be modelling, but from time to time you will also work on other data projects within Centre for Net Zero. Examples of projects you might work on are forecasting the half-hourly energy consumption of a household or predicting whether a household owns low-carbon technologies, like an electric vehicle or heat pump.\nExperience working in energy is beneficial, but not necessary.\n\n\nWhat you'll need\n2+ years developing machine learning or statistical models to solve real-world problems\nFluency in Python and SQL\nAn understanding of the pros and cons of different modelling approaches and what tradeoffs to make for a given problem\nKnowledge of a variety of model evaluation metrics, including the consequences of choosing a particular metric, and model validation strategies\nExperience monitoring deployed models and an awareness of the ways models fail in production\nExperience working with datasets that won’t fit on your laptop, e.g. using cloud services like Google Cloud Platform.\nAttention to detail and curiosity, with an eagerness to learn more about the energy industry\nIt would be great if you had an understanding or interest in...\nTest-driven development\nFairness in ML\nData protection laws (e.g. UK GDPR and DPA) and differential privacy\n\n\nWhy else you'll love it here\nWondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!\nOctopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about!\nWhat do you get? Click here\nClosing date for applications is 23:59 on Wednesday 2nd March.\nIf you are interested in the Centre for Net Zero please send us over your details along with a bit about you and why you're interested.\n\nAt Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic.

        "description": "About ECMWF\nECMWF is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. It is an intergovernmental organisation created in 1975 by a group of European nations and is today supported by 34 Member and Co-operating States, mostly in Europe. The Centre’s mission is to serve and support its Member and Co-operating States and the wider community by developing and providing world-leading global numerical weather prediction. ECMWF functions as a 24/7 research and operational centre with a focus on medium and long-range predictions and holds one of the largest meteorological archives in the world. The success of its activities relies primarily on the talent of its scientists, strong partnerships with its Member and Co-operating States and the international community, some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, and the use of innovative technologies such as machine learning across its operations.\nOver the years, ECMWF has also developed a strong partnership with the European Union, and for the past seven years has been an entrusted entity for the implementation and operation of the Climate Change and the Atmosphere Monitoring Services of the EU's Copernicus component of its Space Programme, as well as a contributor to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The collaboration does not stop there and includes other areas of work, including High Performance Computing and the development of digital tools that enable ECMWF to extend its provision of data and products covering weather, climate, air quality, fire and flood prediction and monitoring.\nECMWF will be a major partner in the implementation of the Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative, together with ESA and EUMETSAT as partners. The objective of the European Commission DestinE initiative is to deploy several highly accurate thematic digital replicas of the Earth, called Digital Twins, to monitor and predict natural and human activities as well as their interactions, to develop and test scenarios that would enable more sustainable developments and support corresponding European policies for the Green Deal.\nECMWF has recently become a multi-site organisation, with its headquarters based since its creation in Reading, UK, its new data centre in Bologna, Italy, and new offices in Bonn, Germany.\nIt has also recently adopted a hybrid organisation model which allows its staff to mix both office working and teleworking. This generous and flexible model provides our staff with considerable flexibility to spend time outside or away from their duty station and decide how they wish to manage their professional working time at ECMWF. ECMWF is an organisation that values the whole being and both understands and values the need for flexibility in the way its staff work.\nFor additional details, see www.ecmwf.int.\nSummary of the role\nThis position is in the Production Services Team, within the Development Section of the Forecast Department.\nThe Production Services Team is responsible for the design and development of all software and systems related to ECMWF’s core data production services. This includes high-throughput specialist software that supports the operational forecast model, systems for acquisition of incoming observations, management of direct model output, perpetual archival of forecasts and observations, notification of data availability, and the generation and dissemination of products to member states and clients.\nThe scalability, performance, and robustness of the full time-critical operational weather forecasting pipeline in the face of future model upgrades is a significant focus of the team. We expect model output data volumes to reach 1 PiB per forecast cycle (four times daily) as we plan for Exascale HPC weather forecasting by 2030, and the volumes of data disseminated are to scale commensurately. The volume and diversity of observations acquired is also expected to increase dramatically. As such, the team actively engages in research of novel, potentially disruptive, algorithms for our data handling systems, and actively works to evaluate upcoming hardware options. The team also invests in the analysis and development of new data access paradigms in support of novel data-centric workflows which will enable users’ insights into ECMWF's massive data sets. As part of this research effort, the team often seeks and secures external funding (e.g. EU Horizon programme) to supplement the investments in the areas of data storage, I/O systems and scalable workflows.\nTo ensure the timely delivery of ECMWF’s forecasts to Member and Co-operating States and other users, observations from around the globe must be quickly collected and forecast output must be delivered to users reliably and according to a tight schedule. These acquisition and dissemination processes are carried out in an automated fashion by the ECMWF Production Data Store (ECPDS). ECPDS also provides a data portal through which external users can pull meteorological products and push observational data.\nECPDS is a largely automated, distributed service comprising indexed data stores and range of data mover machines which are geographically distributed in locations across Europe and other parts of the world to allow caching of meteorological products closer to our users. Recently ECPDS has turned to cloud computing infrastructure for increased scalability and reliability. Furthermore, ECPDS supports native protocols of major cloud storage providers such as Amazon S3, Google and Microsoft Azure.\nThe successful candidate will be responsible, together with the team, for the further development, maintenance, and support of the ECPDS service. This work will involve close cooperation and collaboration with the analysts in the Forecast Delivery Team working on the DevOps configuration.\nMain duties and key responsibilities\nDeveloping and maintaining the ECPDS software\nSupporting the evolution of ECPDS, ensuring scalability in the face of ever-increasing datasets, portability across multiple platforms, and maintaining and improving its quality of service\nSupporting National Meteorological and Hydrological Services with adapting ECPDS to their infrastructure\nProviding development support to the users of ECPDS, the Production Services analysts, and ECMWF’s operations team\nDeveloping and supporting ECMWF’s data notification service\nPersonal attributes\nExcellent analytical and problem-solving skills with a proactive continuous improvement approach\nInitiative and ability to work collaboratively with other ECMWF teams but also able to work independently\nDedication, passion, and enthusiasm to succeed both individually and across teams of developers\nHighly organised with the capacity to work on a diverse range of tasks to tight deadlines\nEducation, experience, knowledge and skills (including language)\nAn advanced university degree (EQF level 7 or above) or equivalent professional experience in computer science or engineering, computational science, physics or natural sciences, mathematics, or related discipline\nDemonstrated experience in developing software to handle large datasets is essential, with strong understanding of I/O concerns and access to data storage\nExperience in developing client/server applications and a good understanding of performance-related issues (memory, disk I/O, networking, etc.) would be a distinct advantage\nExperience in developing and running distributed computing applications or data services with a good understanding of scalability concerns would be advantageous\nExperience with data transfer protocols and network troubleshooting is advantageous\nExperience developing software for, or operating software in high-availability operational environments would be advantageous\nExperience in Object-Oriented Java™, development in UNIX/Linux and software lifecycle maintenance is essential, and experience with C/C++ would be a bonus\nExpertise in SQL database and knowledge of clustering solutions such as MariaDB Galera Cluster would be a plus\nExpertise in deployments using virtual or containerized environments is desirable\nCandidates must be able to work effectively in English and interviews will be conducted in English.\nKnowledge of one of ECMWF’s other working languages (French or German) would be an advantage but is not essential\nOther information\nGrade remuneration\nThe successful candidate will be recruited at the A2 grade, according to the scales of the Co-ordinated Organisations and the annual basic salary will be £63,782.28 or EUR 78,035.40 net of tax. ECMWF also offers a generous benefits package, including a flexible teleworking policy. The position is assigned to the employment category STF-PL as defined in the ECMWF Staff Regulations. Full details of salary scales and allowances available on the ECMWF website at www.ecmwf.int/en/about/jobs, including the ECMWF Staff Regulations and the terms and conditions of employment.\nStarting date: As soon as possible\nLength of contract: Contract to December 2024.\nLocation: This position can be located at the ECMWF HQ in Reading, UK or at its duty station in Bonn, Germany.\nAs a multi-site organisation, ECMWF has adopted a hybrid organisation model which allows flexibility to staff to mix office working and teleworking.\nSuccessful applicants and members of their family forming part of their households will be exempt from immigration restrictions.\nInterviews by videoconference (via Teams ) are expected to take place at the end of April 2022.\nWho can apply\nApplicants are invited to complete the online application form by clicking on the apply button.\nAt ECMWF, we consider an inclusive environment as key for our success.

We make natural foods for pets, which we sell under 3 core brands, as well as producing private label products for major retailers in the UK. The majority of our turnover is in the UK, however we have a subsidiary in Poland that serves the Central European market, and have just established a subsidiary in Shanghai, to look at opportunities in China.Our core Dog Brand, “Butcher’s”, is the leading UK brand in wet dog food, and underwent a major re-brand in 2018/2019, bringing our values of natural nutrition to the fore, and repositioning it in the minds of our loyal consumers. At the end of 2018, we launched a new Super Premium Cat Brand, “Blink!”, that delivers a 100% shredded meat product, produced entirely from British meat. This complements our existing “Classic” range for cats that is still sold in a number of UK retailers.We have made a significant investment into our factory in Crick, Northamptonshire, readying the business for expansion, and the launch/re-launch of the brands as above. We have recruited a new leadership team, and replaced key roles in the business, bringing in new skills from outside the industry to step-change our operations. We are now at a crucial point in our journey, where we have the pieces in place for significant growth, and need to drive the business forward, building an efficient, forward-facing business that becomes the go-to for consumers looking to make healthy choices for their pet.Team overview: Business decisions are based on facts, and a strong Finance Function team is at the heart of the business. Our finance function has recently been split into two: Financial Control and FP&A. The relatively new FP&A function is a high performing team who is valued by our business. It concentrates on business partnering and driving an analytical culture, which improves decision making and helps us uncover ways of improving our business model – a relentless focus on making things better.The team has the responsibility of creating a set of analytical tools that help our business leaders understand how the different areas of our business are performing. They will use these tools to uncover opportunities, and take a hands-on approach, looking at all aspects of our operation – both in the UK and overseas markets and in our factory and office environments. As a manufacturing business, with a large on-site food factory, understanding our products, production cost base, the variables and how to drive efficiency, is key. This isn’t just about writing reports; it is a focus on driving change, challenging our existing thinking, and making a tangible difference to the business.Job Types: Full-time, PermanentSalary: £20,000.00-£25,000.00 per yearBenefits:Company pensionCycle to work schemeEmployee discountOn-site parkingWork from homeSchedule:Monday to FridayAbility to commute/relocate:Crick NN6 7TZ: reliably commute or plan to relocate before starting work (required)Work remotely:Temporarily due to COVID-19"
