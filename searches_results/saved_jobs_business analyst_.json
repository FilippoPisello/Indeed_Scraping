It produces more than half of our energy needs and more than 8 out of 10 homes rely on us for heat, and it’s the primary fuel for power generation, providing a stable base load of electricity. We’re also fully behind the drive to net zero; alongside renewable energy, gas has played a key role in largely removing coal from the energy mix over the past eight years. None of that is going to change overnight. In fact, the UK can’t reach net zero by 2050 without natural gas and hydrogen playing a part in decarbonising transport, power, heat and industry.\n\n\nAlongside that, the amount of work needed on the gas national transmission system (NTS) is bigger than ever for our current regulatory period, RIIO-2. The programme will improve the current network, reducing emissions, and pave the way towards decarbonising future infrastructure. There’s a lot for us to deliver over the next five years, putting our business in a great position to grow.\n\n\nIn March 2021, National Grid announced its intention to sell a majority stake in National Grid Gas plc. We expect that the Gas Transmission business will become a separate company in the first half of 2022.\n\n\nOur values and principles\n\nAt National Grid Gas Transmission, through listening to what our customers need, every day we do the right thing and find a better way.\n\nAs a National Grid Gas Transmission employee, you’ll treat our customers as a priority, taking time to listen and work with them to help give them the best experience we possibly can. You’ll need to be proactive and flexible in your approach and continually look for ways to exceed their expectations – sometimes in unexpected and helpful ways. You’ll provide accessible information when our customers need it and make things simple by using your expertise to guide them. Above all, you’ll follow through on your promises to deliver value, drive efficiency and give them a great customer experience.\n\nWe offer inclusion and diversity training for everyone here at National Grid Gas Transmission, with a view to building an inclusive working environment and developing all our employees. Training opportunities range from unconscious bias and reverse mentoring to targeted training initiatives which are tailored to support our diverse and innovative work force.\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nThis opportunity is available in Warwick\n\n\nThe closing date will be Monday 28th March 2022.\n\n\n#LI-LM1\n\nAt National Grid Gas Transmission, we work towards the highest standards in everything we do, including how we support, value and develop our people. Our aim is to encourage and support employees to thrive and be the best they can be. We celebrate the difference people can bring into our organisation, and welcome and encourage applicants with diverse experiences and backgrounds, and offer flexible and tailored support, at home and in the office.\n\nOur goal is to drive, develop and operate our business in a way that results in a more inclusive culture.

Kingston's riverside location, fantastic retail offer, historic market place and church, parks and gardens all make Kingston town centre the vibrant space it is, and each of our district town centres (Surbiton, New Malden, Tolworth and Chessington) have something unique to offer.\nSituated in Zone 6, Kingston is among the best-connected town centres in London – with direct train links from Kingston and Surbiton stations to Clapham Junction and London Waterloo, as well as Wimbledon for an interchange with the London Underground and Tramlink.\nKingston’s people are innovative and entrepreneurial, and have a strong sense of community pride. The borough has been home to great industry and creativity for many years, reflected in assets such as the Rose Theatre, the International Youth Arts Festival and Kingston University, which boasts more new graduate business start-ups than any other.\nWe have seen tremendous generosity and compassion within our communities, particularly in response to COVID-19, which is a demonstration of Kingston’s key strength. The council offers a strong level of support to vulnerable groups and those who need additional support, which has also increased significantly as a result of the pandemic. Like most places, the average age of our population is rising as more people are living longer, so we are working closely with residents to help them maintain their independence and further improve the cost effectiveness of our service to meet the ongoing rise in demand.\nKingston is home to people from diverse and interesting cultures and backgrounds, which helps to create the rich sense of community shared across the borough. In particular, Kingston has a large Sri Lankan Tamil community and is home to more people from Korea than any other part of the UK.\n\nAbout the Role\nOur mantra here in Digital is people first, technology second.
