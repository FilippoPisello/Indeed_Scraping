It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 12 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide.\n\nWe want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.\n\nWe work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allows us to deliver our orders in around 30 minutes.\n\nAnd we're just getting started.\n\nThe scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.\n\nWe are already a multi-billion pound company that has grown rapidly. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.\n\n\nThe Role\n\n Working together as part of the Analytics Engineering team, your role will be to implement, maintain and support our data and analytics platforms and tooling. You'll also help provide analysts, data scientists, engineers and many other business users with the self-service tools and systems they need to do their work faster, more efficiently and more effectively.\n\nThe initial focus of this role will be our Looker implementation, but you'll need to be willing to also get involved with other systems/tooling in areas such as data management/cataloguing, data quality, data integration and data science.\n\nKey tasks will include the development of enhancements and new features, systems administration and configuration, monitoring, user support, technical optimisation and resolution of bugs/incidents.\n\n\nSkillset\n\nWe want to emphasise that we don't expect you to meet all of the below but we would love for you to have experience in some of the following areas:\n\n Experience implementing and/or maintaining and supporting Looker (or similar)\nExpertise in modern, agile software development processes\nAwareness of principles and practices of delivering modern analytics capabilities at scale\nExcellent communication and collaboration skills\nWorking knowledge of SQL and at least one coding language (ideally Python)\n\n\nLife at Deliveroo\n\nWe are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.\n\nThere are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.\n\n\nDiversity\n\nWe believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around."
